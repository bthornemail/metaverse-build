# Authority-Projection Invariant (Executable)

This module is **not a utility**. It is the **gatekeeper of reality**.

- It encodes the authority law as executable semantics.
- It must halt on violation **before** any projection or IO.
- It must remain pure, total, and lazy.

Status: extracted (frozen)
